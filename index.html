          Hello again! My name is <b>Andrew Rodriguez</b> once again but most people know me as 
          Andy. I grew up in a quite town called Walnut Grove from northern California.
          My father is a farmer and I've helped my dad on his farm and over time I've relized
          that, that life wasn't for and I wanted to be work on tech.
          so I signed up for a bootcamp and now I'm here with devCodeCamp leaning how to code. 
          <br> <br>
          Some of my favorite hobbies are playing video games and football. I've played video games since
          I was 4 years only playing on my brother game cube to building my own gaming pc. Games that I 
          are Call of Duty, Halo, Resident Evil, and so much more. I played football all 4 years of high 
          school. I learned a lot about team work, when I played football I relized how valuable
          being able to communicate with a teammate is. My old teammates and I get together once and a 
          while and just play ball.
